# HowTo Collection

A collection of brief How-To instructions similar to cheat sheets written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for not-so-often-used or long-forgotten tasks.

## Disclaimer

- Make sure you used the commands in these HowTo files before or at least be sure that you know what you are doing using these. So, _**use at your own risk**_!
- Each file starts with one ore more URLs referencing the source of the information used in that file. It can and should also be used as further reading. It should be obvious, but the copyright of those sources belongs completely to their author(s).
- This collection of HowTos is created solely for the purpose of jump-starting my brain so that I can remember some commands I used a while ago or not so often. I publish this collection in the hopes that it might help others as well.
